1. List all of the files in a directory and its subdirectories
    - e.g. the folder used for part of the project on a given day
1. List all of the git changes that have occurred in the parent project at that time

# Usage

1. Use the file picker or enter the path to the directory to list
1. If git is installed and initialized, set the directory which includes .git

# Notes
